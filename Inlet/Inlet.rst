SUBSONIC INLETS
-----------------

On a typical subsonic inlet, the surface of the inlet from outside to inside is a continuous 
smooth curve with some thickness from inside to outside. The most upstream portion of the 
inlet is called the highlight, or the inlet lip. A subsonic aircraft has an inlet with 
a relatively thick lip.
